- Transcript: Oh yeah‚Äîbefore I forget, I literally almost skipped the most important part. The card **Creation** just came out, and it‚Äôs the first time I‚Äôve ever seen it in this deck. That feels significant: it may be the first time you‚Äôre truly showing up for yourself in the ‚Äúgame‚Äù of your life, deciding which cards you‚Äôll play and how your story unfolds. I‚Äôm also seeing someone shuffling a deck, as if you‚Äôre actively rearranging your priorities and choosing what to focus on next. This card speaks to unique expression, a joyful flow of creation, and the importance of opening to the new. You have a singular role to play. Its message reads: _‚ÄúThe comet of creation is my messenger for spiritual evolution, bringing abundant energy for manifestation. When I open my heart to love, this consciousness inspires my intellect with great innovation. I am at the threshold of an evolutionary leap.‚Äù_ The comet‚Äôs blazing light neutralizes shyness, dissolves creative blocks and identity masks, and carries dreams from the spiritual realm into the physical with ease and speed. You are a divine being‚Äî‚Äúa comet full of light‚Äù‚Äîwho incarnated to share a message in tangible form. Your creator consciousness is gently but powerfully expanding. Even if it was suppressed in the past, you‚Äôre now weaving etheric strands that connect with people, places, and energies to manifest your visions. If the downloads feel overwhelming, channel them into expression: write, paint, speak‚Äîwhatever moves the energy into form. Don‚Äôt imitate; find your own path of light. This is confirmation that you‚Äôre ready to create with great love and passion. If you‚Äôve been planning a new project, the inspiration for how to give it shape has arrived. Bypass the linear mind and listen to your heart; connect to the playfulness of your inner child for true confidence. A new facet of yourself is rising to the surface, ready to be seen. Even in stillness, you‚Äôre creating, because your creator consciousness is always active. Bring this flow into the emerging ‚Äúnew earth,‚Äù the new dimension within you that‚Äôs coming to light. Whatever you‚Äôre doing is clearly working‚Äîthe energy keeps reinforcing itself‚Äîand you are more powerful than you realize. Keep going; your time to shine is now.
- _Context:_ Was a great day till 2PM, kinda clearest-best ever and then really struggling with the energy, anxiousness since

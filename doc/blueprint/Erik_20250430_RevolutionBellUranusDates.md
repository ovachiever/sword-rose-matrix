# ⏰ Revolution Bell Exact-Hit Dates
*(when Uranus is aligned within one arc-minute of your 28°46′ Taurus Ascendant)*

| # | Mode             | Calendar date (America/Chicago)             | Clock time † | Cosmic note                                                              |
|---|------------------|---------------------------------------------|--------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1 | Direct entrance  | Saturday May 10 2025                        | ~7 a.m. CDT  | First lightning-strike: sparks of fresh identity and radical self-expression. |
| 2 | Retrograde echo  | Monday December 8 2025 (exact at 00 UTC → 6 p.m. CST on Sun Dec 7) | ~6 p.m. CST  | Deep-coding phase: integrate the surprises, edit the script before Act II. |
| 3 | Direct completion| Wednesday April 1 2026                      | ~9 a.m. CDT  | Upgrade locks in: new freedoms crystallise into your public presence.      |

† Times are rounded from Swiss Ephemeris 00 UT tables and shifted to your local zone (America/Chicago). The exact minute can vary by a handful of minutes as Uranus creeps across 28°46′; if you schedule rituals or intentions, give yourself a ±12-hour window on either side for full effect.

## How to Work with the Rhythm

1.  **May 10 2025 – Ignite**  
    Act on bold instincts; debut the version of you that feels 5 years ahead of schedule.
2.  **Dec 7 / 8 2025 – Integrate**  
    Review, refine, release. What still feels restrictive? Let it go.
3.  **Apr 1 2026 – Anchor**  
    Formalise changes—new look, new title, new trajectory. Commit to the freedom you claimed.

Ride the trilogy consciously and the revolution rings for decades. ⚡

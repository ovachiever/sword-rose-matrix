## 🔮 300-Word Pulse

Today’s sky draws a laser-line through your worth axis. The Sun kissing your Taurus Venus says _“centre pleasure; make it tangible.”_ Immediately, Pluto’s square rumbles, demanding you scrap outdated wealth-and-love stories. Uranus on natal Chiron cracks the cocoon you spun for safety; liberation feels raw before it feels free. A Mars-versus-Mars face-off lights every competitive fuse—great for sprint finishes, dangerous for ego duels. Meanwhile the rare Venus-Saturn union tests dreams: only the parts with firm timbers survive tonight’s tide-check.

Progressed Sun squaring natal Pluto underscores a year of metamorphosis; every external clash mirrors an inner molting. Your progressed Moon in Aries reboots initiative—use it to pioneer, not pontificate. Solar-arc contacts say the boardroom is where alchemy lands: negotiate terms that honour your evolution.

Bottom line: embody the worth you keep preaching, ground the vision in contracts, and let friction forge excellence.

- **Voice:** 108-count mantra “I stabilise abundance in present form.”

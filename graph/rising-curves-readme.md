# Astrocartographic Visualization Assets

This directory contains the visual assets generated for the Sword-Rose Matrix project, including astrocartographic maps, sensitivity plots, and archetypal visualizations.

## File Descriptions

### Rising Curves and Cartography

- **rising_curves.png** - Primary visualization showing the bowed horizon curves for Erik's Uranus and Tiffany's Sun with their intersection in the Altai-Mongolia corridor. This figure appears as Figure 1 in the main paper.

- **Shambhala_Rosslyn_AC_Map.pdf** - High-resolution schematic showing the two critical meridians (92.9°E and 95.1°E) with simplified vertical lines. Suitable for print publication.

### Sensitivity Analysis

- **sensitivity_plot.png** - Violin plot comparing probability distributions under different analytical scenarios: mixed orbs, standard orbs, conservative dependency model, and extreme skeptic scenario.

- **orb_sensitivity_bars.png** - Bar chart showing how different orb size assumptions affect the probability calculations.

### Statistical Visualizations

- **convergence_plot.png** - Line graph demonstrating the convergence of Monte Carlo simulations at different iteration counts.

- **probability_comparison.png** - Chart comparing the statistical improbability across different prophecy configurations.

- **prophecy_coherence.png** - Bar chart visualizing the coherence scores across cultural traditions.

### Conceptual Diagrams

- **archetype_matrix.png** - Visual matrix showing the five core archetypal correspondences across cultural traditions.
